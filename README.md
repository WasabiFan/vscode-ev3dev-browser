## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

*   `ev3devBrowser.password`: If you changed the password on your ev3dev device,
     you will need to set the password here. If you want to manually enter the
     password when you connect or use public key authentication, set this to
     `null`.
*   `ev3devBrowser.env`: If you need to set environment variables for running
    remote programs, you can set them here. Each variable is defined as a
    key/value pair.
*   `ev3devBrowser.download.include`: Use this to specify which files to
    included when downloading files to the remote device. Can use glob patterns.
*   `ev3devBrowser.download.exclude`: Use this to specify which files to
    exclude when downloading files to the remote device. Can use glob patterns.
*   `ev3devBrowser.download.directory`: By default files are downloaded to
    a folder with the same name as the VS Code project. Use this setting to
    save the project files somewhere else. Paths are relative to the `/home/robot`
    directory.
*   `ev3devBrowser.additionalDevices`: A list of additional devices to show in
    the list when connecting to a device. This should only be needed in cases
    where there are network problems interfering with device discover.

More details and examples on the [wiki](https://github.com/ev3dev/vscode-ev3dev-browser/wiki/Settings).


## Known Issues

*   Currently, all downloaded files have the executable bit set.
